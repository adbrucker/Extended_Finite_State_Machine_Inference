# Inference of Extended Finite State Machines (Extended_Finite_State_Machine_Inference)

This git repository contains a local mirror of the 
[Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP)](https://www.isa-afp.org) entry 
[*Inference of Extended Finite State Machines*](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Extended_Finite_State_Machine_Inference.html).

The official AFP releases are tagged. Additionally, this repository
may contain extensions (i.e., a development version) that may be
submitted, as an update to the existing entry, at a later point in time.

## How to build
